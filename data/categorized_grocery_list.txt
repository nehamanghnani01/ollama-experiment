After categorizing and sorting the grocery items, I present to you the following list:

**Produce:**
• Almonds
• Apples
• Bananas
• Bell Peppers
• Broccoli
• Carrots
• Lettuce
• Mushrooms
• Onions
• Potatoes
• Spinach
• Strawberries
• Tomatoes

**Bakery:**

**Pantry:**

• Cereal
• Coffee
• Dish Soap
• Flour
• Honey
• Jam
• Laundry Detergent

**Beverages:**

Note: Some items could fit into multiple categories (e.g., jam can be found in both the Pantry and Beverages section). I've placed them in what seems to be their most likely or common category.

If you'd like, I can also categorize these items by meal type (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner) or provide additional sorting options!
